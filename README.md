ubuntu1204_go
=============

Shippable CI image for  Golang on Ubuntu 12.04. Available go versions:

1. 1.1
2. 1.2
3. 1.3
4. tip
5. release

## How to use
You can use this image to run go builds on Shippable. Just update your
`shippable.yml` file and add the `build_image` directive. You should also
activate the appropriate virtual envrionment so your build runs against the
correct version of go. The go versions you specify in the go directive in the YML will be available in the `$SHIPPABLE_GO_VERSION` environment variable. Here's a sample YML file to get you going:

  - 1.1
